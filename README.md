<strong>Markdown Files (.md)</strong> - This is ideal for the following: reading materials, summary, cheat sheets and activities instructions. Refrain to use this if we have a lot of images

## Naming Conventions

## Structure
Every chapter, article, or task has its folder.

The folder is named like N-url, where N is a number for the sorting purposes and URL is the URL part with the title of the material.

The type of the material is defined by the file inside the folder:

index.md stands for a chapter
article.md stands for an article
task.md stands for a task (solution must be provided in solution.md file as well)
Each of these files starts from the # Main header.

It's very easy to add something new.
